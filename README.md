# Supermarket-Retail-Analysis

## Dataset 
The dataset is a fictional dataset created for helping data analysts practice exploratory data analysis and data visualization. The dataset has data on orders placed by customers on a grocery delivery application and includes details like the order ID, customer name, category, discount and profit made. The dataset is designed with an assumption that the orders are placed by customers living in the state of Tamil Nadu, India.

## Tools Used
The analysis and visualization was done in Excel and Tableau but some rudimentary operations to clean the dataset was done with python. 

The two major activities were:
- Splitting the "Order Date" column into "year", "month", "week", and "day" in order to fully explore some relationships in the dataset.
- Dropping the "State" column as it was unneccesary in the analysis since the data was collated from only one state.

After the rudimentary clean up in python, I exported the dataset as an xlsx file in order to visualize it in Excel

After importing the data into excel, I performed some exploratory analysis using Conditional Formatting and some basic graphs before I went further to answer some question like:
- 3 products to drop fom shelves
- 3 products to promote to increase profit
- Weekday and Month with best sales
- Region with most patronage
- Most popular and Least popular product
